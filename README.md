# 🧠 RBM Digit Reconstruction

A simple AI project that uses a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) to reconstruct handwritten digits (0 to 9) from their hidden representations. 🔁

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project trains an RBM model on the `load_digits` dataset from scikit-learn.  
The goal is to:

- Learn compressed hidden representations of digit images
- Reconstruct the original images from those representations
- Visually compare the original and reconstructed digits

## 💻 Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed.  
You can install all necessary libraries with:
<pre> ```bash pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn ``` </pre
